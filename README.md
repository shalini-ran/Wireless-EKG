# Portable EKG Amplifier with WiFi Functionality

We created a WiFi enabled EKG monitor by designing and assembling a printed circuit board which takes inputs from the electrodes attached the chest. The generated signal is uploaded to a web browser which we developed to display 30 seconds of EKG data. Our team performed both software and hardware testing for the final prototype.

Completed as a project for Biomedical Instrumentation Design course at UT Austin.
